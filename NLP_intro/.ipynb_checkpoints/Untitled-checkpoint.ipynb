    "So... that ended up not being that useful.  We can see that punctuation and filler words make up the bulk of the tokens in this chapter. Luckily, there's a way to get rid of these words, which are called **stop words**. nltk has a built in list of this, but just to give you an idea of what the list looks like, I've spelled out a stopwords list below."

For example, all versions of \"sing\", \"sang\", and \"sung\" would become \"sing\", and both \"pineapple\" and \"pineapples\" would be counted as \"pineapple.\" Finally, we'll retain only alphabetic words to get rid of those pesky punctuation \"words\" like : and \" that were crowding our arrays of common word tokens.
