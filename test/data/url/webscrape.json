The city also serves as an important transportation hub with a relatively good highway connection to Pyongyang, an airport, a port, and the Kangwon railway line. Wonsan is best known to the world as a tourist destination. Its importance as such is highlighted by Kim Jong-un's specific mention in his 2018 New Year's address calling for completion \"in the shortest period of time\" of the Wonsan-Kalma tourist area and paying a visit to give on-the-spot guidance in the spring. This has interesting implications for the economic development of industry in the city as large industrial expansion seems unlikely.<sup>2<\/sup> Even so, Wonsan is home to a handful of light and heavy industries with a dozen or so important companies, including the Wonsan Rolling Stock Complex. The city's industries include steel, shipbuilding, cement, shoes, textiles, tractors, fisheries, and others. There are also a number of universities and at least one research institute in Wonsan. Wonsan's port boasts the greatest length of dock space in the country at approximately 3,166 meters. (Though the port's cargo and coal handling capacity is significantly less than the ports in Chongjin and Nampho.)<\/p><p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Despite being eclipsed in recent news by the tourist zone development, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex plays an important role in the city as well as in the regional and national economies.

As of June 2018, commercial satellite imagery shows that the complex is active and appears well maintained by North Korean standards.<\/p><p>Although North Korean media presents a picture of the facility working at full potential, the production capacity and actual output levels for the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex are unknown. Some dated reports indicate a possible annual production capacity of up to 200 passenger and 2,000 freight cars.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p><p>Commercial satellite imagery and domestic reporting with ground imagery indicate that the complex produces or repairs a wide range of railcars, including 40-ton flat cars, 60-, 100-, and potentially 125-ton ore cars, box\/refrigerator, two-bay hopper (covered and uncovered), log\/lumber, gondolas, passenger cars, and tank. Although none were seen in either satellite and ground imagery, the complex likely produces and repairs specialized maintenance-of-way (MoW) and industrial cars. Additionally, it repairs locomotives (diesel, electric, and steam). The complex may also engage in small-scale scrapping of railcars and locomotives, and the recovery of reusable components.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p><div class=\"captioned-figure-outer\">\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-figure\"><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191605\/Wonsan-manufacturing-operations.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-6848 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191605\/Wonsan-manufacturing-operations-800x478.png\" alt=\"Wonsan manufacturing operations\" width=\"800\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191605\/Wonsan-manufacturing-operations-800x478.png 800w, https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191605\/Wonsan-manufacturing-operations-768x459.png 768w, https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191605\/Wonsan-manufacturing-operations.png 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><div class=\"figcaption wp-caption-text\"><i>Manufacturing operations for ore cars inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.

Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars. As railcar production and repair are heavily dependent upon steel, and to a lesser degree upon iron and aluminum, fluctuations in the supply of these materials undoubtedly affect the output at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.<\/p><p>None of the North Korean media ground imagery reviewed for this report shows either modern manufacturing equipment or techniques employed at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Therefore, the production output is likely significantly lower in quantity and quality to similar-sized facilities in Asia or the West. Additionally, this ground imagery shows a facility that is in need of significant infrastructure maintenance and numerous unaddressed safety issues. Should foreign financial investment be directed to the complex in the future, a substantial amount will likely be absorbed in addressing these issues before any meaningful profit be realized.<\/p><div class=\"captioned-figure-outer\">\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-figure\"><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-6850 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types-800x426.png\" alt=\"Wonsan car types\" width=\"800\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types-800x426.png 800w, https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types-768x409.png 768w, https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types.png 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><div class=\"figcaption wp-caption-text\"><i>Manufacturing operations for a covered hopper (left), ore cars (center) and box car (center rear) inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.

Track was laid from Wonsan (called Genzan at the time by the Japanese) north along the coast through Chongjin (called Seishin at the time by the Japanese) to Hoeryong in the north. Within Wonsan a range of railroad facilities were constructed to support this rail line and service the port facilities. Among these facilities was the KaIma Railroad Plant built by the Japanese in the early 1940s immediately south of the city.  \r\n\r\nThe KaIma Railroad Plant was reportedly destroyed during World War II when Soviet troops occupied the city. During the immediate post\u2013World War II period, the nascent North Korean government took control of the rail network within the northern half of the peninsula and began its reconstruction with Soviet assistance. This included the KaIma Railroad Plant, which was renamed the Wonsan Railroad Factory. Underscoring the importance of the facility to the nation at this time, Kim Il-song visited the Wonsan Railroad Factory in 1947 and provided what has subsequently become known as \u201con-the-spot guidance.\u201d \r\n\r\nDuring the Korean War, Wonsan, including the Wonsan Railroad Factory, was heavily damaged by United Nations Command air strikes. With the signing of the Armistice Agreement in 1953, North Korea undertook reconstruction efforts with assistance from China, the Soviet Union, and other communist countries.

Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars.

Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars. As railcar production and repair are heavily dependent upon steel, and to a lesser degree upon iron and aluminum, fluctuations in the supply of these materials undoubtedly affect the output at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.<\/p><p>None of the North Korean media ground imagery reviewed for this report shows either modern manufacturing equipment or techniques employed at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Therefore, the production output is likely significantly lower in quantity and quality to similar-sized facilities in Asia or the West. Additionally, this ground imagery shows a facility that is in need of significant infrastructure maintenance and numerous unaddressed safety issues. Should foreign financial investment be directed to the complex in the future, a substantial amount will likely be absorbed in addressing these issues before any meaningful profit be realized.<\/p><p><div class=\"captioned-figure-outer\"><div class=\"captioned-figure\"><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-6850 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types-800x426.png\" alt=\"Wonsan car types\" width=\"800\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a><div class=\"figcaption wp-caption-text\"><i>Manufacturing operations for a covered hopper (left), ore cars (center) and box car (center rear) inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.

Wonsan is best known to the world as a tourist destination. Its importance as such is highlighted by Kim Jong-un's specific mention in his 2018 New Year's address calling for completion \"in the shortest period of time\" of the Wonsan-Kalma tourist area and paying a visit to give on-the-spot guidance in the spring.

The city's industries include steel, shipbuilding, cement, shoes, textiles, tractors, fisheries, and others. There are also a number of universities and at least one research institute in Wonsan. Wonsan's port boasts the greatest length of dock space in the country at approximately 3,166 meters.

Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars. As railcar production and repair are heavily dependent upon steel, and to a lesser degree upon iron and aluminum, fluctuations in the supply of these materials undoubtedly affect the output at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.<\/p><p>None of the North Korean media ground imagery reviewed for this report shows either modern manufacturing equipment or techniques employed at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Therefore, the production output is likely significantly lower in quantity and quality to similar-sized facilities in Asia or the West. Additionally, this ground imagery shows a facility that is in need of significant infrastructure maintenance and numerous unaddressed safety issues. Should foreign financial investment be directed to the complex in the future, a substantial amount will likely be absorbed in addressing these issues before any meaningful profit be realized.<\/p><p><div class=\"captioned-figure-outer\"><div class=\"captioned-figure\"><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-6850 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/04191738\/Wonsan-car-types-800x426.png\" alt=\"Wonsan car types\" width=\"800\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a><div class=\"figcaption wp-caption-text\"><i>Manufacturing operations for a covered hopper (left), ore cars (center) and box car (center rear) inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.

Most significantly, Chongjin is also home to North Korea's second-most active trading port, accounting for 24.2 percent of the country's import\/export activity in general cargo, agricultural goods, coal, and steel.

The Chongjin Railway Factory is one of just five major industrial facilities that undertake railcar production and depot-level repairs for the nationwide network. It is primarily engaged in the manufacture, repair, and scrap of railcars. Some small parts are likely manufactured within the factory, while others are scavenged from scrapped railcars or procured from local light industries. While the factory is active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6698 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01-800x599.jpg\" alt=\"ChongjinRailwayFactory-01\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01-800x599.jpg 800w, https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01-768x575.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>The Chongjin Railway Factory (41.793718 129.796317) is located in the eastern section of Chongjin city and adjacent to the Chongjin Chongnyon Rail Station.

The importance of the rail network to the nation at this time is indicated by the story that Kim Jong-suk, an anti-Japanese partisan and Kim Il-sung\u2019s first wife, reportedly visited Chongjin in December 1945 to \"encourage railway workers to take active part in the struggle for building a new country after the country's liberation from Japan's colonial rule.\u201d  Kim Il-sung is reported to have stated during this immediate postwar period:\r\n\u201cIn order to build a new Korea, we must reconstruct the destroyed industry as soon as possible and create a prosperous economy.

One of the first areas for reconstruction was the rail network throughout the nation.  As with the other major rail facilities the Chongjin railroad workshops were rebuilt with machine tools and equipment imported from China, the Soviet Union, and Poland. \r\n\r\nIt is presently unclear both when the railroad shops at Chongjin were officially renamed the Chongjin Railway Factory and when the facility was expanded to allow for the serial production of railcars.  Declassified satellite imagery from January 1976, however, shows a facility that differs little in size and composition from that seen on the U.S.  Army\u2019s 1946 city map.

While this may have been a reflection of the expanding practice for industrial facilities to undertake work outside their normal area of operations, it appears to be more an indication that the factory was still facing significant challenges in procuring raw materials (for railcar production). This assertion appears supported by a nationwide campaign that year to collect scrap iron for use in steel mills. The Ministry of Railways was responsible for transporting the collected scrap iron to the steel mills and claimed great success in doing so.

While the factory is active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6698 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194137\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-01-800x599.jpg\" alt=\"ChongjinRailwayFactory-01\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>The Chongjin Railway Factory (41.793718 129.796317) is located in the eastern section of Chongjin city and adjacent to the Chongjin Chongnyon Rail Station. As of February 2018, the Chongjin Railway Factory is an active repair and production facility and is being maintained at a reasonable level by North Korean standards. While there are approximately 140 railcars of various types present in the railyard, there are no visible indications of any significant new railcar production. This activity, however, could easily be missed if it is undertaken at a low level.<\/p><p>There are no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the factory since he came to power. However, attesting to the facility's historical importance to the economy, a number of reported high-level visits to the factory have been undertaken by Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and other senior officials over the years. Furthermore, railcar manufacture and repair, as well as the Chongjin Railway Factory itself, have been frequently mentioned in North Korean media.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p><p>Despite the importance of railway system and by extension its associated manufacturing facilities, outside knowledge of North Korea's infrastructure is lacking, according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondparallel.csis.org\/unification-transparency-index\/\">CSIS Beyond Parallel<\/a>. When experts from the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Russia were polled, approximately 50 percent said they believed there was insufficient or no empirical analysis available on infrastructure. For example, of the South Korean experts surveyed, 46 percent said this of China, 50 percent of Japan, and 71 percent of Russia.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194310\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-02.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6699 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194310\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-02-800x599.jpg\" alt=\"ChongjinRailwayFactory-02\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>Commercial satellite imagery indicates the primary type of railcars manufactured and serviced at the factory are gondolas and hoppers used primarily to haul mineral ore and coal from mines to heavy industries and powerplants in the province, especially the Songjin Iron and Steel Complex, Sonbong Thermal Powerplant, Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex, and Chongjin Structural Steel Works. In turn, the Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex and Chongjin Structural Steel Works provide the finished and semi-finished products to the Chongjin Railway Factory for railcar manufacture and repair.<\/p><p>Aside from the movement of rail cars, few external changes of significance have been observed at the factory between 2006 and 2018 with the exception of the replacement of an assembly\/repair hall roof between 2016 and 2017, and the replacement of roofs on a second assembly\/repair hall roof and support building between 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194550\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-03.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6701 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194550\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-03-800x601.jpg\" alt=\"ChongjinRailwayFactory-03\" width=\"800\" height=\"601\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>With regards to the movement of railcars, those positioned on tracks leading to the main assembly\/repair hall on the east side of the facility exhibit regular changes in numbers and types of railcars present. A number of tracks on the west side of the yard, apparently used to store railcars for scavenging spare parts and eventual scrapping, have railcars that have not moved in years.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194642\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-04.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6702 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/d1c1jxr970h1ka.cloudfront.net\/public\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/15194642\/ChongjinRailwayFactory-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"ChongjinRailwayFactory-04\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>The imagery also shows piles of rubbish throughout the facility. However, this is somewhat typical of railroad facilities such as this and should not necessarily be taken as an indicator of level of activity. Obvious in any summer or fall imagery of the factory is that almost all open space at the Chongjin Railway Factory is used for gardening. While such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea, the level seen at the Chongjin Railway Factory appears somewhat high which is likely an indicator of a reduced level of railway-related activity.<\/p><p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p><p>1.
