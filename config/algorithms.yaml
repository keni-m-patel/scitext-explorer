#Change empty list into list with objects: config for training data location, percentage into training data, number of topics
#Example: LDA:

#	-False				(if want to use a pretrained model, set to True. if want to partition data and use new model set to False)
#	-.8 		     		(if want to set training test data, enter number from 0 - 1, will not work if second item of list is set to True)
#	-10		     		(enter number of topics, if preset model is used it is already set in pretrained model)
